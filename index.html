        So chances are you just clicked through all of those exercises on
        Code Cademy and now your not quite sure how to add some gradient
        behind your cover image? Just look up Stack, it hasn't failed you so far.

      <p>REACT.JS looks scarey as, and you can't even get the button below to
        turn <a href="#" class="link-medium">GREEN</a> how are you going to get

      </p>

      <h2>MERN..? ðŸŽ®</h2>
      <p>
        What are you going to do when you have to lead React? Everyone is talking
        about MERN, and you know &#128642; but it's ok, your Mac has more stickers on
        it then anyone else so its all good.
